class Solution {
public:
    // Function to sort the array using bubble sort algorithm.
    void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
        // Outer loop: iterate through each element up to the second-to-last
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // Inner loop: iterate through the unsorted part of the array
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                // Compare adjacent elements and swap if they are in the wrong order
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
In the worst case, where the array is in reverse order, the algorithm performs n(n-1)/2 comparisons and swaps. Hence, the time complexity is quadratic.
