ðŸ§© Problem Solved: Occurence of an integer in a Linked List
ðŸ”— Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/drRmqKD6

class Solution
{
public:
    int count(struct node* head, int search_for)
    {
        // Initialize a temporary pointer to the head of the linked list
        node *temp = head;

        // Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences of the search value
        int count = 0;

        // Traverse the linked list until the end is reached (temp becomes NULL)
        while(temp != NULL)
        {
            // Check if the data at the current node is equal to the search value
            if(temp->data == search_for)
            {
                // If it is, increment the counter
                count++;
            }

            // Move to the next node in the linked list
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        // Return the final count of occurrences of the search value
        return count;
    }
};

//Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm traverses the entire linked list once.
