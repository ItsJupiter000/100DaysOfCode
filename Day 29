ðŸ”— Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/g_mdEQDf

int upperBound(vector<int> &arr, int x, int n) {
    // Initialize low, high, and mid for binary search
    int low = 0;
    int high = n - 1;
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

    // Binary search loop
    while (low <= high) {
        // Check if x is equal to the middle element
        if (x == arr[mid]) {
            // Move to the right to find the last occurrence of x
            while (arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]) {
                mid++;
            }
            return mid + 1;
        } else if (x < arr[mid]) {
            // If x is smaller, search in the left half
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            // If x is greater, search in the right half
            low = mid + 1;
        }

        // Update mid for the next iteration
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    }

    // If x is not found, return the position where it should be inserted
    return mid;
}

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) as it performs binary search on a sorted array.
