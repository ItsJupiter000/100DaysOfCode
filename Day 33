ðŸ§© Problem Solved: Insert at end of Doubly Linked List
ðŸ”— Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/dQdbji7B

Node* insertAtTail(Node* head, int k) {
    // Create a new node with data k
    Node* node1 = new Node(k);

    // If the linked list is empty, make the new node the head and return
    if (head == NULL) {
        head = node1;
        return head;
    }

    // Traverse the linked list to find the last node
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // Link the new node to the last node
    temp->next = node1;
    node1->prev = temp;

    return head;
}

//The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because in the worst case, it needs to traverse the entire linked list to find the last node before inserting the new node.
